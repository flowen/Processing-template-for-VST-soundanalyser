# Processing-template-for-VST-soundanalyser
A very simple template from which you can read the current values, max values and average for each algorithm made by Adam Stark. 

Run Adam’s Stark Sound analyser in a DAW and the template will receive the OSC and pick up the values. 

I personally like to use it to get a quick reading and see what algorithms I want to use to represent in my audio-visual work.
